# Hobbitcraft Files
This is the official place for all hobbitcraft files! Most small things will be published as releases here on the github, but some things are a bit too big to fit here so im going to be providing external links to download them.

The download for the Season 4 modpack/world is [Here](https://github.com/DerpDerpling/Hobbitcraft-S4/releases)

The download for the Season 3 world is [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Cw7VqkEgiEEQMBjvxCsnxvR1BQGY9SX/view?usp=sharing)
